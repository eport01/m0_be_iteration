# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

* I feel pretty good about the `each` method! I had to google how to do the second question in each.rb and it took me a lot of trial and error to finally make it work. *

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

*There was definitely a lot of productive struggle. I spent a long time googling how to filter an array so that it only outputs something with 3 letters

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I'm still struggling to find the answer to how to filter an array based off of the first letter of a word. The example in the lesson was print only the words that begin with "P". I'm going to look into this more and ask it on slack.
